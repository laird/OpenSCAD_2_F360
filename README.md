OpenSCAD_2_F360
===============
Working on a OpenSCAD translator for Autodesk Fusion 360 (in and out)

TODO:
* Port a hand to Fusion
* 360 handomatic: http://e-nable.youmagine.com/

* Define approach
* Fusion api overview
* How are people using openscad
* Project ideas, phases
* What each person can contribute
* Includes language choice
* Get OpenSCAD samples translated to python or JS Fusion script to start define mapping
* Create modules for mapping to standard operations in OpenSCAD (list here)
* Fusion object model is mapped to JavaScript now, Python on the 8th, C++ early next year.
* Perhaps use Solid Python to do the mapping from Fusion to OpenSCAD?
